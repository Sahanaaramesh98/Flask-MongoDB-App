**Project Name** - Flask Todo Application with MongoDB

### Overview:
I have developed a **Todo Application** using **Flask** and **MongoDB** as part of my journey into web development. This simple yet functional application allows users to add and delete todo items, and it stores the data in a MongoDB database. The project includes a sleek HTML template for rendering the data and demonstrates how to integrate Flask with MongoDB for efficient data handling.

### What I’ve Accomplished:
- **Set up the local development environment**: Configured my system with the necessary tools and libraries for Flask and MongoDB integration.
- **Installed Flask and pymongo**: Installed the required packages to use Flask for the web app and pymongo for MongoDB integration.
- **Created and configured MongoDB database**: Set up a MongoDB database and created a collection specifically for storing todo items.
- **Built a functional Flask web application**: Developed routes to add, view, and delete todo items, allowing the user to interact with the database easily.
- **Designed a clean HTML template**: Created an elegant HTML layout to display todo items beautifully and provide an intuitive user experience.
- **Implemented add and delete functionality**: Created Flask routes that handle adding new tasks and deleting existing ones from the MongoDB collection.
- **Ran and tested the application locally**: Verified that the app works perfectly by running it on my local machine and testing all routes.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python framework used to build the web application.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing todo items.
- **pymongo**: MongoDB driver for Python, used to interact with the database.
- **HTML/CSS**: Designed the front-end of the application.

### What I’ve Learned:
- How to integrate Flask with MongoDB for data storage.
- Building web applications from scratch, including frontend and backend.
- Setting up routes for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a Flask app.
- Enhancing user experience by designing a clean, functional UI for interacting with the app.
